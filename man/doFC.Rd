\title{generate the fold change}
\usage{
doFC(scene, BranchA, BranchB, tree, ratio, data, pct, adjB = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{scene}{Scenarios (\dQuote{S1}, \dQuote{S2}, \dQuote{S3})}

\item{BranchA}{the branch node label of branch A.}

\item{BranchB}{the branh node label of branch B.}

\item{tree}{a phylo object}

\item{ratio}{the proportion ratio between \code{BranchB} and \code{BranchA} (B/A)}

\item{data}{the real data (count table)}

\item{pct}{the percentage (in number) of the leaves in BranchA that will swap with BranchB.}

\item{adjB}{a numeric value between 0 and 1 (only for \code{scene} is \dQuote{S3}). Default is NULL. If NULL, branch A and branch B swap their proportions. If a numeric value, e.g. 0.1, then branch B decreases to its one tenth proportion and the decrease in branch B is added to branch A. For example, assume there are two experimental conditions (C1 & C2), branch A has 10 and branch B has 40 in C1. If adjB is set to 0.1, then in C2 branch B becomes 4 and branch A 46 so that the total proportion stays the same.}
