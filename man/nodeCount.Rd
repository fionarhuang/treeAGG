\title{Calculate the counts at internal nodes}
\usage{
nodeCount(tipTable, wtree, stree = NULL, fun = sum)
}
\arguments{
\item{tipTable}{the tip count table}

\item{wtree}{a tree (phylo class)}

\item{stree}{a list of phylo class;
a list of subtrees cut at internal nodes of the wtree}

\item{fun}{a function to create the count of an internal node based on the counts at its descendant leaf nodes. The default is sum}
}
\value{
a count table (matrix class) with a row representing a node and
a column representing a sample.
}
\description{
\code{nodeCount} is to calculate the counts at internal nodes. The count of an internal node is the sum of counts at its descendant leaves.
}
\examples{
data("tinyTree")
(p <- ggtree(tinyTree) + geom_text(aes(label = label)))

count <- matrix(rpois(100, 10), nrow =10)
rownames(count) <- tinyTree$tip.label
colnames(count) <- paste(c("C1_", "C2_"),
c(1:5, 1:5), sep = "")

count_tinyTree <- nodeCount(tipTable = count,
wtree = tinyTree, fun = mean)

# check to see whether the count of an internal node is the sum
# of counts of its descendant leaves.
# here, check the first sample as an example

nod <- tx_node(tree = tinyTree, input = rownames(count_tinyTree))
d <- cbind.data.frame(node = nod, count = count_tinyTree[, 1])

ggtree(tinyTree) \%<+\% d + geom_text2(aes(label = count))
