\title{Find the ancestors of specified nodes}
\usage{
findAncestor(tree, node, level, treeMat = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo object}

\item{node}{A vector of node numbers or node labels}

\item{level}{A vector of numbers to define nth generation before the
specified nodes}

\item{treeMat}{A matrix with each row representing a path. The entry is node
number. The first column is leaf node numbers. The columns are organized as
the order of nodes in the paths connecting leaves and the root. Default is
null, treeMat is generated automatically. The treeMat is provided when the
tree is very large to save running time.}
}
\value{
a vector of node numbers
}
\description{
\code{findAncestor} finds the ancestor in the nth generation above
specified nodes.
}
\examples{
library(ggtree)
data(exTree)
ggtree(exTree, branch.length = 'none') +
 geom_text2(aes(label = node))

 findAncestor(tree = exTree, node = c(53, 61), level = 1)
