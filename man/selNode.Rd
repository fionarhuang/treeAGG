\title{select a branch}
\usage{
selNode(tree, data, minTip = 0, maxTip = Inf, minPr = 0, maxPr = Inf,
  skip = NULL, all = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{a phylo object}

\item{data}{a count table from the real data or a list output from \code{parEstimate}.}

\item{minTip}{the minimum number of leaves in the selected branch}

\item{maxTip}{the maximum number of leaves in the selected branch}

\item{minPr}{the minimum count proportion of the selected branch in a sample}

\item{maxPr}{the maximum count proportion of the selected branch in a sample}

\item{skip}{a character vector of node labels. These nodes are not the descendants or the ancestors of the selected branch.}

\item{all}{TRUE or FALSE. Default is FALSE. If FALSE, the branch node of a branch, which meet the requirements and has the minimum count proportion, is returned; otherwise branch nodes of all branches meeting the requirements are returned.}
}
\value{
the node whose descendant branch has the lowest proportion
}
\description{
\code{selNode} is to select a branch meeting the specified criteria in the number of leaves and the count proportion.

data("simTree")
