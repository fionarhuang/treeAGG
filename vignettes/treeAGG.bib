  abstract = "High-dimensional flow and mass cytometry allow cell types and
              states to be characterized in great detail by measuring
              expression levels of more than 40 protein markers per cell. Here,
              we present diffcyt, a new computational framework for
              differential discovery analyses in these datasets, based on (i)
              high-resolution clustering and (ii) empirical Bayes moderated
              tests adapted from transcriptomics. Our approach provides
              improved statistical performance, including for rare cell
              populations, along with flexible experimental designs and fast
              runtimes in an open-source framework.",
